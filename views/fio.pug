    p.content-heading  What are the Various Milestones for Baby Photography??
    br
    p.content-material(data-aos='fade-up')
      | Broadly speaking, there are 4 opportunities to photograph the babies in the first year of birth.
      | The first milestone is Newborn Photography. This happens in the first 40 days. However, the most ideal time
      | is from 5 to 20 days of age.
      | The second milestone is Infant Photography. This happens between 2 and 6 months. Half birthday sessions are
      | also part of this.
      | The third milestone is Sitter Photography. This can happen as soon as the baby starts sitting without
      | support for about 10 minutes. Generally done from 7 to 16 months.
      | The fourth stage is Cake Smash Photography. This can happen anytime from 10 months to 18 months. We
      | generally prefer to combine Sitter and Cake Smash Session in a single photography session.
