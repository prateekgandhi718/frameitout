She had awesome ideas and had beautiful props that I didn&apos;t had to bother about anything.I am now confused what all to get framed as all photos are out of the world. Thank you for memories of lifetime.&rdquo;

        | &ldquo;Parul.. well &ldquo;AMAZING&rdquo; is the word for her !! The day Parul had sent her sample pictures for the baby shoot .. that very day I had decided she would shoot my baby ! Her work was impeccable !!! And to be honest I initially thought may b it&rsquo;s all editing work that has made pictures great .. but I was entirely wrong ..!!! It&rsquo;s all real .. n she is a master in capturing those beautiful wonderous moments of babies .. As a person she is so calm and patient .. coz dealing with babies is a Herculean task in itself .. but she makes it all simple and joyous. Me and my husband .. got total fan of her dedication, sincerity and hard work .. n trust me all of these qualities are proven by her pictures.. Parul .. M really glad I chose u .. n in future too will pick u without any doubt ! Way to go gal .. !! Keep rocking.&rdquo;
